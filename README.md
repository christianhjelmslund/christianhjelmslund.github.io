## About

This personal site which can be interpreted as some sort of personal playground, where I can write blog posts, show previous projects and more. It should be viewed as an exploratory process, which can go in many directions - which is an easy way for me to say that I am a bit unsure what the future brings and whether I will focus solely on tech and coding, or also transtion into lifestyle, health and etc. 🌱

I would love to write around one post per week, but I'm unsure whether I can commit to this or if I lose motivation at some point... Let's see.

Is there something you feel is off or afraid to start a project from scratch? I welcome everyone to fork the project, pick up an issue and open a PR. Collaboration is key. I have also tried to enforce some sort of agile methodology by creating small tasks, make branches, PR's but in the end, being a sole developer on the project, it can feel a bit silly and in more often than not, I don't follow it strictly unfortunately.

## Tech stack
### React
* Redux
* Bootstrap
* Axios
* Enzyme + Jest
### Firebase

I will probably migrate from Firebase and create my own server when I want more control myself (soon). I also enjoy system architecture and backend development, so it is a natural step to take, even though for this particular case Firebase's functionality and ease-to-setup is great.

## Getting Started
### Prerequisites
* npm

``` 
npm install npm@latest -g 
```
### Installation
```
git clone git@github.com:christianhjelmslund/christianhjelmslund.dev.git
```
Navigate into the directory
```
npm install
npm start
```
### Contributing
As mentioned, you are welcome to contribute to this site if you feel like there is something fun that could be added or if you want to pick up an issue
```
1. Fork the Project
2. Create your Feature Branch (`git checkout -b feature/AmazingFeature`)
3. Commit your Changes (`git commit -m 'Add some AmazingFeature'`)
4. Push to the Branch (`git push origin feature/AmazingFeature`)
5. Open a Pull Request
```
